For more information about resolvers, see [Resolver Mapping Template Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference.html).\n  When you submit an update, CFNLong updates resources based on differences between what you submit and the stack's current template. To cause this resource to be updated you must change a property value for this resource in the CFNshort template.
