Reference data used by the `pulumi-aws-native` provider.

## ref-db.json

Metadata describing the behavior of the [CloudFormation Ref Intrinsic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-ref.html).

What Ref returns varies from resource to resource. The only available information on this is free-form text in CloudFormation documentation and anything that can be extracted experimentally. To facilitate building tooling such as `pulumi/pulumi-cdk` that emulates CF behavior, `ref-db.json` collects schematized information describing the behavior of `Ref`.

`ref-db.json` can be edited directly to correct errors or add entries for resources not yet covered.

## regions.json

AWS regions and their names.

Please do not edit this file directly.

This list can be refreshed by extracting from `botocore`. See `.botocore.version`.
