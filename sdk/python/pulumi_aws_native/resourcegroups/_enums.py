    Specifies the type of resource query that determines this group's membership. There are two valid query types:

    - `TAG_FILTERS_1_0` indicates that the group is a tag-based group. To complete the group membership, you must include the `TagFilters` property to specify the tag filters to use in the query.
    - `CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0` , the default, indicates that the group is a CloudFormation stack-based group. Group membership is based on the CloudFormation stack. You must specify the `StackIdentifier` property in the query to define which stack to associate the group with, or leave it empty to default to the stack where the group is defined.
