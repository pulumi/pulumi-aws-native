      The ``IPAddressType`` must match the IP type of the subnet. Additionally, the ``IPAddressType`` parameter overrides the value set as the default IP address for the subnet in the VPC. For example, if the ``IPAddressType`` is ``IPV4_ONLY`` and ``AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation`` is ``true``, then IPv4 is used for the mount target.
