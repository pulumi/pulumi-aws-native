class AutomationRuleMapFilterComparison(str, Enum):
    """
    The condition to apply to the key value when filtering Security Hub findings with a map filter.
     To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
      +  To search for values that include the filter value, use ``CONTAINS``. For example, for the ``ResourceTags`` field, the filter ``Department CONTAINS Security`` matches findings that include the value ``Security`` for the ``Department`` tag. In the same example, a finding with a value of ``Security team`` for the ``Department`` tag is a match.
      +  To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use ``EQUALS``. For example, for the ``ResourceTags`` field, the filter ``Department EQUALS Security`` matches findings that have the value ``Security`` for the ``Department`` tag.
      
      ``CONTAINS`` and ``EQUALS`` filters on the same field are joined by ``OR``. A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters ``Department CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance`` match a finding that includes either ``Security``, ``Finance``, or both values.
     To search for values that don't have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
      +  To search for values that exclude the filter value, use ``NOT_CONTAINS``. For example, for the ``ResourceTags`` field, the filter ``Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance`` matches findings that exclude the value ``Finance`` for the ``Department`` tag.
      +  To search for values other than the filter value, use ``NOT_EQUALS``. For example, for the ``ResourceTags`` field, the filter ``Department NOT_EQUALS Finance`` matches findings that don’t have the value ``Finance`` for the ``Department`` tag.
      
      ``NOT_CONTAINS`` and ``NOT_EQUALS`` filters on the same field are joined by ``AND``. A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters ``Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance`` match a finding that excludes both the ``Security`` and ``Finance`` values.
      ``CONTAINS`` filters can only be used with other ``CONTAINS`` filters. ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filters can only be used with other ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filters.
     You can’t have both a ``CONTAINS`` filter and a ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can’t have both an ``EQUALS`` filter and a ``NOT_EQUALS`` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. 
      ``CONTAINS`` and ``NOT_CONTAINS`` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *User Guide*.
