         You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CFN templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CFN always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.
         The [regex pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:
          +  Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (``\\u0020``) through the end of the ASCII character range
          +  The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\\u00FF``)
          +  The special characters tab (``\\u0009``), line feed (``\\u000A``), and carriage return (``\\u000D``)

        Search the [CloudFormation User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) for `AWS::IAM::UserPolicy` for more information about the expected schema for this property.
