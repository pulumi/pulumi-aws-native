In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds `maxvCpus` by more than a single instance.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] subnets: The VPC subnets where the compute resources are launched. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For Fargate compute resources, providing an empty list will be handled as if this parameter wasn't specified and no change is made. For Amazon EC2 compute resources, providing an empty list removes the VPC subnets from the compute resource. For more information, see [VPCs and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* .

               If you choose `SPOT` , you must also specify an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role with the `spotIamFleetRole` parameter. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 spot fleet role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
               
               When updating the type of a compute environment, changing between `EC2` and `SPOT` or between `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT` will initiate an infrastructure update, but if you switch between `EC2` and `FARGATE` , AWS CloudFormation will create a new compute environment.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] allocation_strategy: The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or [Amazon EC2 service limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) . For more information, see [Allocation strategies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
               
               When updating a compute environment, changing the allocation strategy requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . `BEST_FIT` is not supported when updating a compute environment.
               
               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. 
               
               - **BEST_FIT (default)** - AWS Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren't available, AWS Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren't enough instances available, or if the user is reaching [Amazon EC2 service limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) then additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with `BEST_FIT` then the Spot Fleet IAM role must be specified.
               - **BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE** - AWS Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, AWS Batch will select new instance types.
               - **SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED** - AWS Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.
               - **SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED** - The price and capacity optimized allocation strategy looks at both price and capacity to select the Spot Instance pools that are the least likely to be interrupted and have the lowest possible price. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.
               
               > We recommend that you use `SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED` rather than `SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED` in most instances.
               
               With `BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE` , `SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED` , and `SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED` allocation strategies using On-Demand or Spot Instances, and the `BEST_FIT` strategy using Spot Instances, AWS Batch might need to go above `maxvCpus` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds `maxvCpus` by more than a single instance.
        :param pulumi.Input[int] bid_percentage: The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, the Spot price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. For most use cases, we recommend leaving this field empty.
               
               When updating a compute environment, changing the bid percentage requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
               
               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.
        :param pulumi.Input[int] desiredv_cpus: The desired number of vCPUS in the compute environment. AWS Batch modifies this value between the minimum and maximum values based on job queue demand.
               
               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it. > AWS Batch doesn't support changing the desired number of vCPUs of an existing compute environment. Don't specify this parameter for compute environments using Amazon EKS clusters. > When you update the `desiredvCpus` setting, the value must be between the `minvCpus` and `maxvCpus` values.
               > 
               > Additionally, the updated `desiredvCpus` value must be greater than or equal to the current `desiredvCpus` value.

        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input['ComputeEnvironmentEc2ConfigurationObjectArgs']]] ec2_configuration: Provides information used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for Amazon EC2 instances in the compute environment. If `Ec2Configuration` isn't specified, the default is `ECS_AL2` .
               
               When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . To remove the Amazon EC2 configuration and any custom AMI ID specified in `imageIdOverride` , set this value to an empty string.
               
               One or two values can be provided.
               
               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ec2_key_pair: The Amazon EC2 key pair that's used for instances launched in the compute environment. You can use this key pair to log in to your instances with SSH. To remove the Amazon EC2 key pair, set this value to an empty string.
               
               When updating a compute environment, changing the Amazon EC2 key pair requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment.

               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] image_id: The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is overridden by the `imageIdOverride` member of the `Ec2Configuration` structure. To remove the custom AMI ID and use the default AMI ID, set this value to an empty string.
               
               When updating a compute environment, changing the AMI ID requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
               
               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it. > The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1 instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see [Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#ecs-optimized-ami-linux-variants.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .
        :param pulumi.Input[str] instance_role: The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. Required for Amazon EC2 instances. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, `*ecsInstanceRole*` or `arn:aws:iam:: *<aws_account_id>* :instance-profile/ *ecsInstanceRole*` . For more information, see [Amazon ECS instance role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance_IAM_role.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
               
               When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
               
               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] instance_types: The instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, `c5` or `p3` ), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as `c5.8xlarge` ). You can also choose `optimal` to select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that match the demand of your job queues.
               
               When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
               
               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it. > When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For example, you can't mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environment. > Currently, `optimal` uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families. In Regions that don't have instance types from those instance families, instance types from the C5, M5, and R5 instance families are used.
        :param pulumi.Input['ComputeEnvironmentLaunchTemplateSpecificationArgs'] launch_template: The launch template to use for your compute resources. Any other compute resource parameters that you specify in a [CreateComputeEnvironment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_CreateComputeEnvironment.html) API operation override the same parameters in the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both. For more information, see [Launch Template Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html) in the ** . Removing the launch template from a compute environment will not remove the AMI specified in the launch template. In order to update the AMI specified in a launch template, the `updateToLatestImageVersion` parameter must be set to `true` .
               
               When updating a compute environment, changing the launch template requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the ** .
               
               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
        :param pulumi.Input[int] minv_cpus: The minimum number of vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment is `DISABLED` ).
               
               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] placement_group: The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more information, see [Placement groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .
               
               When updating a compute environment, changing the placement group requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] security_group_ids: The Amazon EC2 security groups that are associated with instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is required for Fargate compute resources, where it can contain up to 5 security groups. For Fargate compute resources, providing an empty list is handled as if this parameter wasn't specified and no change is made. For Amazon EC2 compute resources, providing an empty list removes the security groups from the compute resource.
               
               When updating a compute environment, changing the Amazon EC2 security groups requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
        :param pulumi.Input[str] spot_iam_fleet_role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a `SPOT` compute environment. This role is required if the allocation strategy set to `BEST_FIT` or if the allocation strategy isn't specified. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 spot fleet role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
               
               > This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it. > To tag your Spot Instances on creation, the Spot Fleet IAM role specified here must use the newer *AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole* managed policy. The previously recommended *AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole* managed policy doesn't have the required permissions to tag Spot Instances. For more information, see [Spot instances not tagged on creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#spot-instance-no-tag) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] tags: A key-value pair to associate with a resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] update_to_latest_image_version: Specifies whether the AMI ID is updated to the latest one that's supported by AWS Batch when the compute environment has an infrastructure update. The default value is `false` .
               
               > An AMI ID can either be specified in the `imageId` or `imageIdOverride` parameters or be determined by the launch template that's specified in the `launchTemplate` parameter. If an AMI ID is specified any of these ways, this parameter is ignored.

Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. For Amazon EC2 resources, you must specify at least one vCPU. This is required but can be specified in several places; it must be specified for each node at least once.

        The default for the Fargate On-Demand vCPU resource count quota is 6 vCPUs. For more information about Fargate quotas, see [AWS Fargate quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecs-service.html#service-quotas-fargate) in the *AWS General Reference* .

        For jobs that are running on Fargate resources, then `value` must match one of the supported values and the `MEMORY` values must be one of the values supported for that `VCPU` value. The supported values are 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16
