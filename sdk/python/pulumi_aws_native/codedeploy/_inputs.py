        The number or percentage of instances that must remain available per Availability Zone during a deployment. This option works in conjunction with the `MinimumHealthyHosts` option.

        The period of time, in seconds, that CodeDeploy must wait after completing a deployment to an Availability Zone. CodeDeploy will wait this amount of time before starting a deployment to the next Availability Zone. Consider adding a monitor duration to give the deployment some time to prove itself (or 'bake') in one Availability Zone before it is released in the next zone. If you don't specify a `monitorDurationInSeconds` , CodeDeploy starts deploying to the next Availability Zone immediately.
