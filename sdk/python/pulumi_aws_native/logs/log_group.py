               You can use field index policies to create *field indexes* on fields found in log events in the log group. Creating field indexes lowers the costs for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those field indexes, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields that have high cardinality of values Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and instance IDs.

This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the KMS key is still within CWL. This enables CWL to decrypt this data whenever it is requested.
                If you attempt to associate a KMS key with the log group but the KMS key doesn't exist or is deactivated, you will receive an ``InvalidParameterException`` error.
                Log group data is always encrypted in CWL. If you omit this key, the encryption does not use KMS. For more information, see [Encrypt log data in using](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/encrypt-log-data-kms.html)

Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields that have high cardinality of values Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and instance IDs.
