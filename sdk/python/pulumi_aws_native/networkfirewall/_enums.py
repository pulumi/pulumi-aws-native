    Defines what Network Firewall should do with the packets in a traffic flow when the flow matches the stateful rule criteria. For all actions, Network Firewall performs the specified action and discontinues stateful inspection of the traffic flow.

    The actions for a stateful rule are defined as follows:

    - *PASS* - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination.
    - *DROP* - Blocks the packets from going to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the firewall logging configuration.
    - *REJECT* - Drops traffic that matches the conditions of the stateful rule and sends a TCP reset packet back to sender of the packet. A TCP reset packet is a packet with no payload and a `RST` bit contained in the TCP header flags. `REJECT` is available only for TCP traffic.
    - *ALERT* - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the firewall logging configuration.

    You can use this action to test a rule that you intend to use to drop traffic. You can enable the rule with `ALERT` action, verify in the logs that the rule is filtering as you want, then change the action to `DROP` .
    - *REJECT* - Drops TCP traffic that matches the conditions of the stateful rule, and sends a TCP reset packet back to sender of the packet. A TCP reset packet is a packet with no payload and a `RST` bit contained in the TCP header flags. Also sends an alert log mesage if alert logging is configured in the firewall logging configuration.
