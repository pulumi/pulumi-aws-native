        :param str path_pattern: The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg``) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.
                 You can optionally include a slash (``/``) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg``. CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/``.
                 The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.
                For more information, see [Path Pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param str target_origin_id: The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.
        :param str viewer_protocol_policy: The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern``. You can specify the following options:
                 +   ``allow-all``: Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.
                 +   ``redirect-to-https``: If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.
                 +   ``https-only``: If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).
                 
                For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see [Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                 The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see [Managing Cache Expiration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param Sequence[str] allowed_methods: A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:
                 +  CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests.
                 +  CloudFront forwards only ``GET``, ``HEAD``, and ``OPTIONS`` requests.
                 +  CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST``, and ``DELETE`` requests.
                 
                If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.
        :param str cache_policy_id: The unique identifier of the cache policy that is attached to this cache behavior. For more information, see [Creating cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy) or [Using the managed cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                A ``CacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues``. We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId``.
        :param Sequence[str] cached_methods: A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:
                 +  CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests.
                 +  CloudFront caches responses to ``GET``, ``HEAD``, and ``OPTIONS`` requests.
                 
                If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.
        :param bool compress: Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see [Serving Compressed Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param float default_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field.

                The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age``, ``Cache-Control s-maxage``, and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see [Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param str field_level_encryption_id: The value of ``ID`` for the field-level encryption configuration that you want CloudFront to use for encrypting specific fields of data for this cache behavior.
        :param 'DistributionForwardedValues' forwarded_values: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see [Working with policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy.

                If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see [Creating origin request policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy) or [Using the managed origin request policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                A ``CacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues``. We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId``.
                A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.
        :param Sequence['DistributionFunctionAssociation'] function_associations: A list of CloudFront functions that are associated with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.
        :param 'DistributionGrpcConfig' grpc_config: The gRPC configuration for your cache behavior.
        :param Sequence['DistributionLambdaFunctionAssociation'] lambda_function_associations: A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.
        :param float max_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see [Creating cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy) or [Using the managed cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age``, ``Cache-Control s-maxage``, and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see [Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param float min_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see [Creating cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy) or [Using the managed cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see [Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers``, if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name``).
        :param str origin_request_policy_id: The unique identifier of the origin request policy that is attached to this cache behavior. For more information, see [Creating origin request policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy) or [Using the managed origin request policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param str realtime_log_config_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the real-time log configuration that is attached to this cache behavior. For more information, see [Real-time logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param str response_headers_policy_id: The identifier for a response headers policy.
        :param bool smooth_streaming: Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true``; if not, specify ``false``. If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming``, you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern``.
        :param Sequence[str] trusted_key_groups: A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.
                When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see [Serving private content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param Sequence[str] trusted_signers: We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners``.
                 A list of AWS-account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.
                When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer's AWS-account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature.

                You can specify the object name or a path to the object name (for example, ``index.html`` or ``exampleFolderName/index.html``). Your string can't begin with a forward slash (``/``). Only specify the object name or the path to the object.
                If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.
                To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.
                To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object.
                For more information about the default root object, see [Specify a default root object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param str http_version: (Optional) Specify the HTTP version(s) that you want viewers to use to communicate with CF. The default value for new distributions is ``http1.1``.
                For viewers and CF to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLSv1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Indication (SNI).
                For viewers and CF to use HTTP/3, viewers must support TLSv1.3 and Server Name Indication (SNI). CF supports HTTP/3 connection migration to allow the viewer to switch networks without losing connection. For more information about connection migration, see [Connection Migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-connection-migration) at RFC 9000. For more information about supported TLSv1.3 ciphers, see [Supported protocols and ciphers between viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html).
        :param bool ipv6_enabled: If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true``. If you specify ``false``, CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution.
                In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see [Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                If you're using an R53AWSIntlong alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:
                 +  You enable IPv6 for the distribution
                 +  You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects
                 
                For more information, see [Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
                If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with R53AWSIntlong or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.
        :param 'DistributionLogging' logging: A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution.
                For more information about logging, see [Access Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param 'DistributionOriginGroups' origin_groups: A complex type that contains information about origin groups for this distribution.
                Specify a value for either the ``Origins`` or ``OriginGroups`` property.
        :param Sequence['DistributionOrigin'] origins: A complex type that contains information about origins for this distribution.
                Specify a value for either the ``Origins`` or ``OriginGroups`` property.
        :param str price_class: The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All``, CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations.
                If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All``, CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance.
                For more information about price classes, see [Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*. For information about CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class 100) map to CloudFront regions, see [Amazon CloudFront Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/).
        :param 'DistributionRestrictions' restrictions: A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.
        :param 'DistributionLegacyS3Origin' s3_origin: The origin as an S3 bucket.
                 This property is legacy. We recommend that you use [Origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cloudfront-distribution-origin.html) instead.
        :param bool staging: A Boolean that indicates whether this is a staging distribution. When this value is ``true``, this is a staging distribution. When this value is ``false``, this is not a staging distribution.
        :param 'DistributionViewerCertificate' viewer_certificate: A complex type that determines the distribution's SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.
        :param str web_acl_id: A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111``. To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111``.
                 WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html).

        A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if request URLs don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.
        :param str target_origin_id: The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.
        :param str viewer_protocol_policy: The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern``. You can specify the following options:
                 +   ``allow-all``: Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.
                 +   ``redirect-to-https``: If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.
                 +   ``https-only``: If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).
                 
                For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see [Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                 The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see [Managing Cache Expiration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param Sequence[str] allowed_methods: A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:
                 +  CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests.
                 +  CloudFront forwards only ``GET``, ``HEAD``, and ``OPTIONS`` requests.
                 +  CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST``, and ``DELETE`` requests.
                 
                If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.
        :param str cache_policy_id: The unique identifier of the cache policy that is attached to the default cache behavior. For more information, see [Creating cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy) or [Using the managed cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                A ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues``. We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId``.
        :param Sequence[str] cached_methods: A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:
                 +  CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests.
                 +  CloudFront caches responses to ``GET``, ``HEAD``, and ``OPTIONS`` requests.
                 
                If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.
        :param bool compress: Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true``; if not, specify ``false``. For more information, see [Serving Compressed Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param float default_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see [Creating cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy) or [Using the managed cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age``, ``Cache-Control s-maxage``, and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see [Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param str field_level_encryption_id: The value of ``ID`` for the field-level encryption configuration that you want CloudFront to use for encrypting specific fields of data for the default cache behavior.
        :param 'DistributionForwardedValues' forwarded_values: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see [Working with policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see [Creating cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy) or [Using the managed cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see [Creating origin request policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy) or [Using the managed origin request policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                A ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues``. We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId``.
                A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.
        :param Sequence['DistributionFunctionAssociation'] function_associations: A list of CloudFront functions that are associated with this cache behavior. Your functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.
        :param 'DistributionGrpcConfig' grpc_config: The gRPC configuration for your cache behavior.
        :param Sequence['DistributionLambdaFunctionAssociation'] lambda_function_associations: A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.
        :param float max_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see [Creating cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy) or [Using the managed cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age``, ``Cache-Control s-maxage``, and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see [Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param float min_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see [Creating cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy) or [Using the managed cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see [Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
                You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers``, if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name``).
        :param str origin_request_policy_id: The unique identifier of the origin request policy that is attached to the default cache behavior. For more information, see [Creating origin request policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy) or [Using the managed origin request policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param str realtime_log_config_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the real-time log configuration that is attached to this cache behavior. For more information, see [Real-time logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param str response_headers_policy_id: The identifier for a response headers policy.
        :param bool smooth_streaming: Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true``; if not, specify ``false``. If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming``, you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern``.
        :param Sequence[str] trusted_key_groups: A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.
                When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see [Serving private content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
        :param Sequence[str] trusted_signers: We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners``.
                 A list of AWS-account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.
                When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer's AWS-account. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature.
