    Set this to `DIMENSIONAL` for an AWS managed monitor. AWS managed monitors automatically track up to the top 5,000 values by cost within a dimension of your choosing. Each dimension value is evaluated independently. If you start incurring cost in a new value of your chosen dimension, it will automatically be analyzed by an AWS managed monitor.

    Set this to `CUSTOM` for a customer managed monitor. Customer managed monitors let you select specific dimension values that get monitored in aggregate.
