When you connect a function to a VPC, Lambda creates an elastic network interface for each combination of security group and subnet in the function's VPC configuration. The function can only access resources and the internet through that VPC. For more information, see [VPC Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html).

    ///  To monitor network interfaces, CFN needs the ``ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`` permission. It obtains this from the user or role that modifies the stack. If you don't provide this permission, CFN does not wait for network interfaces to be deleted.
