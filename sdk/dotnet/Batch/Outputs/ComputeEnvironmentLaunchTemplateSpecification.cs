It's only changed if the `updateToLatestImageVersion` parameter for the compute environment is set to `true` . During an infrastructure update, if either `$Latest` or `$Default` is specified, AWS Batch re-evaluates the launch template version, and it might use a different version of the launch template. This is the case even if the launch template isn't specified in the update. When updating a compute environment, changing the launch template requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
