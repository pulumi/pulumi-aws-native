This value can be retrieved from the `allocationId` field from the Amazon EC2 [Address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Address.html) data type. One way to retrieve this value is by calling the EC2 [DescribeAddresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddresses.html) API.
