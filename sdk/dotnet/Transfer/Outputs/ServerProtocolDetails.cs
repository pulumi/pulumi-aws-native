        /// 
        /// `aws transfer update-server --protocol-details PassiveIp=0.0.0.0`
        /// 
        /// Replace `0.0.0.0` in the example above with the actual IP address you want to use.
        /// 
        /// &gt; If you change the `PassiveIp` value, you must stop and then restart your Transfer Family server for the change to take effect. For details on using passive mode (PASV) in a NAT environment, see [Configuring your FTPS server behind a firewall or NAT with AWS Transfer Family](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storage/configuring-your-ftps-server-behind-a-firewall-or-nat-with-aws-transfer-family/) . 
        /// 
        /// *Special values*
        /// 
        /// The `AUTO` and `0.0.0.0` are special values for the `PassiveIp` parameter. The value `PassiveIp=AUTO` is assigned by default to FTP and FTPS type servers. In this case, the server automatically responds with one of the endpoint IPs within the PASV response. `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` has a more unique application for its usage. For example, if you have a High Availability (HA) Network Load Balancer (NLB) environment, where you have 3 subnets, you can only specify a single IP address using the `PassiveIp` parameter. This reduces the effectiveness of having High Availability. In this case, you can specify `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` . This tells the client to use the same IP address as the Control connection and utilize all AZs for their connections. Note, however, that not all FTP clients support the `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` response. FileZilla and WinSCP do support it. If you are using other clients, check to see if your client supports the `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` response.

However, these commands are not compatible with object storage systems, such as Amazon S3. Due to this incompatibility, file uploads from these clients can result in errors even when the file is otherwise successfully uploaded.

TLS Session Resumption provides a mechanism to resume or share a negotiated secret key between the control and data connection for an FTPS session. `TlsSessionResumptionMode` determines whether or not the server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID. This property is available during `CreateServer` and `UpdateServer` calls. If a `TlsSessionResumptionMode` value is not specified during `CreateServer` , it is set to `ENFORCED` by default.
