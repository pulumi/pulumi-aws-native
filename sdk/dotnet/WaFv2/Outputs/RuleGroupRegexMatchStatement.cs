Include the single `FieldToMatch` type that you want to inspect, with additional specifications as needed, according to the type. You specify a single request component in `FieldToMatch` for each rule statement that requires it. To inspect more than one component of the web request, create a separate rule statement for each component.

        /// Example JSON for a `QueryString` field to match:
        ///

        /// 
        /// - Even though all `FieldToMatch` settings are available, the only valid settings for field redaction are `UriPath` , `QueryString` , `SingleHeader` , and `Method` .
        /// - In this documentation, the descriptions of the individual fields talk about specifying the web request component to inspect, but for field redaction, you are specifying the component type to redact from the logs.
        /// - If you have request sampling enabled, the redacted fields configuration for logging has no impact on sampling. The only way to exclude fields from request sampling is by disabling sampling in the web ACL visibility configuration.
