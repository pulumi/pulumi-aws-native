In the event that an Application Load Balancer experiences high-load conditions or suspected DDoS attacks, the `ACTIVE_UNDER_DDOS` protection automatically rate limits traffic from known low reputation sources without disrupting Application Load Balancer availability. `ALWAYS_ON` protection provides constant, always-on monitoring of known low reputation sources for suspected DDoS attacks. While this provides a higher level of protection, there may be potential impacts on legitimate traffic.
