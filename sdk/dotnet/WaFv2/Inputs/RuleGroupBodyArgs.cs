When a web request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are within the limit to AWS WAF for inspection.
        /// 
        /// - For Application Load Balancer and AWS AppSync , the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
        /// - For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase the limit for each resource type in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
        /// 
        /// The options for oversize handling are the following:
        /// 
        /// - `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
        /// - `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. AWS WAF applies the rule action to the request.
        /// - `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.
        /// 
        /// You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.
