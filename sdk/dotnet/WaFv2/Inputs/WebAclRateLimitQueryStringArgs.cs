Text transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the `FieldToMatch` request component before inspecting it, and they're used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transformations to apply, AWS WAF performs all transformations on the specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then uses the transformed component contents.
