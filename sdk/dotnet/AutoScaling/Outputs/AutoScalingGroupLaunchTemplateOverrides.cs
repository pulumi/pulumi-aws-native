    ///  Specify the instance types that you want, or define your instance requirements instead and let Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling provision the available instance types that meet your requirements.

You can view which instance types are matched before you apply the instance requirements to your Auto Scaling group.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances until the desired capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are two units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can only launch an instance with a ``WeightedCapacity`` of five units, the instance is launched, and the desired capacity is exceeded by three units. For more information, see [Configure instance weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups-instance-weighting.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
