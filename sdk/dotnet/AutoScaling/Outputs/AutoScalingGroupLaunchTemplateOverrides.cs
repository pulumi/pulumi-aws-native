    ///   +  Override the instance type that is specified in the launch template.
    ///   +  Use multiple instance types.
    ///   
    ///  Specify the instance types that you want, or define your instance requirements instead and let Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling provision the available instance types that meet your requirements. This can provide Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling with a larger selection of instance types to choose from when fulfilling Spot and On-Demand capacities. You can view which instance types are matched before you apply the instance requirements to your Auto Scaling group.
    ///  After you define your instance requirements, you don't have to keep updating these settings to get new EC2 instance types automatically. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the instance requirements of the Auto Scaling group to determine whether a new EC2 instance type can be used.

This is useful for provisioning instances from different Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in the same Auto Scaling group. To do this, create the AMIs and create a new launch template for each AMI.

When a Spot or On-Demand Instance is launched, the capacity units count toward the desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances until the desired capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are two units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can only launch an instance with a ``WeightedCapacity`` of five units, the instance is launched, and the desired capacity is exceeded by three units. For more information, see [Configure instance weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups-instance-weighting.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

However, if you configure a mixed instances policy that defines weights for the instance types, you must specify these sizes with the same units that you use for weighting instances.
