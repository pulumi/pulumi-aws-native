When choosing `MANY_TO_MANY` , the system can match attributes across the sub-types of an attribute type. For example, if the value of the `Email` field of Profile A and the value of `BusinessEmail` field of Profile B matches, the two profiles are matched on the `Email` type. When choosing `ONE_TO_ONE` ,the system can only match if the sub-types are exact matches. For example, only when the value of the `Email` field of Profile A and the value of the `Email` field of Profile B matches, the two profiles are matched on the `Email` type.
