    /// A bucket-level setting for Amazon S3 general purpose buckets used to prevent the upload of new objects encrypted with the specified server-side encryption type. For example, blocking an encryption type will block ``PutObject``, ``CopyObject``, ``PostObject``, multipart upload, and replication requests to the bucket for objects with the specified encryption type. However, you can continue to read and list any pre-existing objects already encrypted with the specified encryption type. For more information, see [Blocking or unblocking SSE-C for a general purpose bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.html).
