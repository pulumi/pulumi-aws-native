If your ``Filter`` includes a ``Tag`` element, the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` ``Status`` must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see [Basic Rule Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config).
