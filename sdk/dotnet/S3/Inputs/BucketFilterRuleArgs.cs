    /// Specifies the Amazon S3 object key name to filter on. An object key name is the name assigned to an object in your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify whether to filter on the suffix or prefix of the object key name. A prefix is a specific string of characters at the beginning of an object key name, which you can use to organize objects. For example, you can start the key names of related objects with a prefix, such as ``2023-`` or ``engineering/``. Then, you can use ``FilterRule`` to find objects in a bucket with key names that have the same prefix. A suffix is similar to a prefix, but it is at the end of the object key name instead of at the beginning.
