    ///  To create your customized metric specification:
    ///   +  Add values for each required parameter from CloudWatch. You can use an existing metric, or a new metric that you create. To use your own metric, you must first publish the metric to CloudWatch. For more information, see [Publish custom metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.
    ///   +  Choose a metric that changes proportionally with capacity. The value of the metric should increase or decrease in inverse proportion to the number of capacity units. That is, the value of the metric should decrease when capacity increases, and increase when capacity decreases. 
    ///   
    ///  For an example of how creating new metrics can be useful, see [Scaling based on Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*. This topic mentions Auto Scaling groups, but the same scenario for Amazon SQS can apply to the target tracking scaling policies that you create for a Spot Fleet by using Application Auto Scaling.
