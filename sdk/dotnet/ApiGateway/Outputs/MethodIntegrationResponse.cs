The mapping key must match the pattern of `method.response.header.{name}` , where `name` is a valid and unique header name.

For example, if the success response returns nothing and the error response returns some string, you could use the `.+` regex to match error response. However, make sure that the error response does not contain any newline ( `\n` ) character in such cases. If the back end is an AWS Lambda function, the AWS Lambda function error header is matched. For all other HTTP and AWS back ends, the HTTP status code is matched.
