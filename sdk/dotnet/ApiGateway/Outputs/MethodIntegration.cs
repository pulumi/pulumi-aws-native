The valid value is one of the following: `WHEN_NO_MATCH` : passes the method request body through the integration request to the back end without transformation when the method request content type does not match any content type associated with the mapping templates defined in the integration request. `WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES` : passes the method request body through the integration request to the back end without transformation when no mapping template is defined in the integration request. If a template is defined when this option is selected, the method request of an unmapped content-type will be rejected with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response. `NEVER` : rejects the method request with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response when either the method request content type does not match any content type associated with the mapping templates defined in the integration request or no mapping template is defined in the integration request.

Standard 80 and 443 ports are supported as well as custom ports above 1024.

If `connectionType` is `VPC_LINK` specify the Network Load Balancer DNS name. For `AWS` or `AWS_PROXY` integrations, the URI is of the form `arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:path|action/{service_api}` . Here, {Region} is the API Gateway region (e.g., us-east-1); {service} is the name of the integrated AWS service (e.g., s3); and {subdomain} is a designated subdomain supported by certain AWS service for fast host-name lookup. action can be used for an AWS service action-based API, using an Action={name}&amp;{p1}={v1}&amp;p2={v2}... query string. The ensuing {service_api} refers to a supported action {name} plus any required input parameters. Alternatively, path can be used for an AWS service path-based API. The ensuing service_api refers to the path to an AWS service resource, including the region of the integrated AWS service, if applicable. For example, for integration with the S3 API of GetObject, the uri can be either `arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:action/GetObject&amp;Bucket={bucket}&amp;Key={key}` or `arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:path/{bucket}/{key}`
