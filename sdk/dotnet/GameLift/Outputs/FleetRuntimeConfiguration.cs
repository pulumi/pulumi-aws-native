Each instance in the fleet maintains server processes as specified in the runtime configuration, launching new ones as existing processes end. Each instance regularly checks for an updated runtime configuration makes adjustments as called for.
    /// 
    /// The runtime configuration enables the instances in a fleet to run multiple processes simultaneously. Potential scenarios are as follows: (1) Run multiple processes of a single game server executable to maximize usage of your hosting resources. (2) Run one or more processes of different executables, such as your game server and a metrics tracking program. (3) Run multiple processes of a single game server but with different launch parameters, for example to run one process on each instance in debug mode.

    /// An Amazon GameLift instance is limited to 50 processes running simultaneously. A runtime configuration must specify fewer than this limit. To calculate the total number of processes specified in a runtime configuration, add the values of the ConcurrentExecutions parameter for each ServerProcess object in the runtime configuration.
