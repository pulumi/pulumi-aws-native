New game sessions that are started on the fleet are assigned an IP address/port number combination, which must fall into the fleet's allowed ranges.

For Realtime Servers fleets, Amazon GameLift automatically opens two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP, for use by the Realtime servers.
