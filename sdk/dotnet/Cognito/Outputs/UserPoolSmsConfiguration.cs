You can configure the role trust policy to require that Amazon Cognito, and any principal, provide the `ExternalID` . If you use the Amazon Cognito Management Console to create a role for SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA), Amazon Cognito creates a role with the required permissions and a trust policy that demonstrates use of the `ExternalId` .
