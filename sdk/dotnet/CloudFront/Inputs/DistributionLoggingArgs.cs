    /// A complex type that specifies whether access logs are written for the distribution.
    ///   If you already enabled standard logging (legacy) and you want to enable standard logging (v2) to send your access logs to Amazon S3, we recommend that you specify a *different* Amazon S3 bucket or use a *separate path* in the same bucket (for example, use a log prefix or partitioning). This helps you keep track of which log files are associated with which logging subscription and prevents log files from overwriting each other. For more information, see [Standard logging (access logs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
