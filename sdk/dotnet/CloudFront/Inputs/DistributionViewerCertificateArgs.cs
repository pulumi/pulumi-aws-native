    /// A complex type that determines the distribution's SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.
    ///  If the distribution doesn't use ``Aliases`` (also known as alternate domain names or CNAMEs)—that is, if the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net``—set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` and leave all other fields empty.
    ///  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), use the fields in this type to specify the following settings:
    ///   +  Which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from: only viewers that support [server name indication (SNI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) (recommended), or all viewers including those that don't support SNI.
    ///   +  To accept HTTPS connections from only viewers that support SNI, set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only``. This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)
    ///   +  To accept HTTPS connections from all viewers, including those that don't support SNI, set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``vip``. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)
    ///   
    ///   +  The minimum SSL/TLS protocol version that the distribution can use to communicate with viewers. To specify a minimum version, choose a value for ``MinimumProtocolVersion``.

You specify the location by setting a value in one of the following fields (not both):
    ///   +   ``ACMCertificateArn`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``AcmCertificateArn``. Note the different capitalization.)
    ///   +   ``IAMCertificateId`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``IamCertificateId``. Note the different capitalization.)

    ///   
    ///  All distributions support HTTPS connections from viewers.
