    ///   +  The headers that CloudFront automatically includes in every origin request, including ``Host``, ``User-Agent``, and ``X-Amz-Cf-Id``.
    ///   +  All HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings that are specified in the cache policy or the origin request policy. These can include items from the viewer request and, in the case of headers, additional ones that are added by CloudFront.
    ///   
    ///  CloudFront sends a request when it can't find an object in its cache that matches the request. If you want to send values to the origin and also include them in the cache key, use ``CachePolicy``.
