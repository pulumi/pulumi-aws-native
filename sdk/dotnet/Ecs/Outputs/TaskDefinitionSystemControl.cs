    /// A list of namespaced kernel parameters to set in the container. This parameter maps to ``Sysctls`` in the docker container create command and the ``--sysctl`` option to docker run. For example, you can configure ``net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time`` setting to maintain longer lived connections.
    ///  We don't recommend that you specify network-related ``systemControls`` parameters for multiple containers in a single task that also uses either the ``awsvpc`` or ``host`` network mode. Doing this has the following disadvantages:
    ///   +  For tasks that use the ``awsvpc`` network mode including Fargate, if you set ``systemControls`` for any container, it applies to all containers in the task. If you set different ``systemControls`` for multiple containers in a single task, the container that's started last determines which ``systemControls`` take effect.
    ///   +  For tasks that use the ``host`` network mode, the network namespace ``systemControls`` aren't supported.
    ///   
    ///  If you're setting an IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task, the following conditions apply to your system controls. For more information, see [IPC mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_definition_ipcmode).
    ///   +  For tasks that use the ``host`` IPC mode, IPC namespace ``systemControls`` aren't supported.
    ///   +  For tasks that use the ``task`` IPC mode, IPC namespace ``systemControls`` values apply to all containers within a task.
    ///   
    ///   This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.
    ///    This parameter is only supported for tasks that are hosted on FARGATElong if the tasks are using platform version ``1.4.0`` or later (Linux). This isn't supported for Windows containers on Fargate.
