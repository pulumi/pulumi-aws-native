    /// The ``HealthCheck`` property specifies an object representing a container health check. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks that exist in the container image (such as those specified in a parent image or from the image's Dockerfile). This configuration maps to the ``HEALTHCHECK`` parameter of docker run.
    ///   The Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks specified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor Docker health checks that are embedded in a container image and not specified in the container definition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks that exist in the container image.
    ///   If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue its lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of a service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped and the service scheduler will replace it.
    ///  The following are notes about container health check support:
    ///   +  Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon ECS container agent. For more information, see [Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html).
    ///   +  Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you are using platform version 1.1.0 or greater. For more information, see [Platform Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html).
    ///   +  Container health checks are not supported for tasks that are part of a service that is configured to use a Classic Load Balancer.
