This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service is using the ``REPLICA`` service scheduler and has a ``desiredCount`` of four tasks and a ``maximumPercent`` value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default ``maximumPercent`` value for a service using the ``REPLICA`` service scheduler is 200%.

This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity.

        ///   If any tasks are unhealthy and if ``maximumPercent`` doesn't allow the Amazon ECS scheduler to start replacement tasks, the scheduler stops the unhealthy tasks one-by-one — using the ``minimumHealthyPercent`` as a constraint — to clear up capacity to launch replacement tasks.
