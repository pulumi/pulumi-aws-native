This version supports enhanced observability for Amazon ECS clusters using the Amazon EC2 and Fargate launch types. After you configure Container Insights with enhanced observability on Amazon ECS, Container Insights auto-collects detailed infrastructure telemetry from the cluster level down to the container level in your environment and displays these critical performance data in curated dashboards removing the heavy lifting in observability set-up.
