Set to DETECTION_AND_REDACTION to both identify and mask sensitive data - this produces two output files per detection scope: one unredacted file with detection information and one redacted file with masking applied to sensitive content. For example, if detectionScope includes both STANDARD and CUSTOM with DETECTION_AND_REDACTION mode, four output files will be generated (two for standard output and two for custom output).

The number of output files generated depends on both the detection mode and the scopes selected - each scope specified will produce its own set of output files according to the detection mode configured.
