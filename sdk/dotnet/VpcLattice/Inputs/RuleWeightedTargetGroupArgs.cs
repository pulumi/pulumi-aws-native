For example, if you specify two target groups, each with a weight of 10, each target group receives half the requests. If you specify two target groups, one with a weight of 10 and the other with a weight of 20, the target group with a weight of 20 receives twice as many requests as the other target group. If there's only one target group specified, then the default value is 100.
