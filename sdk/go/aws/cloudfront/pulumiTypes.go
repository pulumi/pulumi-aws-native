//
//	If the distribution doesn't use ``Aliases`` (also known as alternate domain names or CNAMEs)—that is, if the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net``—set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` and leave all other fields empty.
//	If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), use the fields in this type to specify the following settings:
//	 +  Which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from: only viewers that support [server name indication (SNI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) (recommended), or all viewers including those that don't support SNI.
//	 +  To accept HTTPS connections from only viewers that support SNI, set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only``. This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)
//	 +  To accept HTTPS connections from all viewers, including those that don't support SNI, set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``vip``. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)
//
//	 +  The minimum SSL/TLS protocol version that the distribution can use to communicate with viewers. To specify a minimum version, choose a value for ``MinimumProtocolVersion``. For more information, see [Security Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
//	 +  The location of the SSL/TLS certificate, [(ACM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html) (recommended) or [(IAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html). You specify the location by setting a value in one of the following fields (not both):
//	 +   ``ACMCertificateArn`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``AcmCertificateArn``. Note the different capitalization.)
//	 +   ``IAMCertificateId`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``IamCertificateId``. Note the different capitalization.)
//
//	All distributions support HTTPS connections from viewers. To require viewers to use HTTPS only, or to redirect them from HTTP to HTTPS, use ``ViewerProtocolPolicy`` in the ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior``. To specify how CloudFront should use SSL/TLS to communicate with your custom origin, use ``CustomOriginConfig``.
//	For more information, see [Using HTTPS with CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https.html) and [Using Alternate Domain Names and HTTPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-alternate-domain-names.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

	IamCertificateId *string `pulumi:"iamCertificateId"`
	// If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

	//   On the CloudFront console, this setting is called *Security Policy*.
	//   When you're using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only``), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)
	//  If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true``), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

	//   +   ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don't support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront.
	//   +   ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the [Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/support/home).
