	// - `cancelled` - The Capacity Reservation was canceled. The reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.
	// - `pending` - The Capacity Reservation request was successful but the capacity provisioning is still pending.
	// - `failed` - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A request can fail due to request parameters that are not valid, capacity constraints, or instance limit constraints. You can view a failed request for 60 minutes.
	// - `scheduled` - ( *Future-dated Capacity Reservations* ) The future-dated Capacity Reservation request was approved and the Capacity Reservation is scheduled for delivery on the requested start date.
	// - `payment-pending` - ( *Capacity Blocks* ) The upfront payment has not been processed yet.
	// - `payment-failed` - ( *Capacity Blocks* ) The upfront payment was not processed in the 12-hour time frame. Your Capacity Block was released.
	// - `assessing` - ( *Future-dated Capacity Reservations* ) Amazon EC2 is assessing your request for a future-dated Capacity Reservation.
	// - `delayed` - ( *Future-dated Capacity Reservations* ) Amazon EC2 encountered a delay in provisioning the requested future-dated Capacity Reservation. Amazon EC2 is unable to deliver the requested capacity by the requested start date and time.
	// - `unsupported` - ( *Future-dated Capacity Reservations* ) Amazon EC2 can't support the future-dated Capacity Reservation request due to capacity constraints. You can view unsupported requests for 30 days. The Capacity Reservation will not be delivered.
