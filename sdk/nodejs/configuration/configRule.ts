/**
 * You must first create and start the CC configuration recorder in order to create CC managed rules with CFNlong. For more information, see [Managing the Configuration Recorder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/stop-start-recorder.html).
 *   Adds or updates an CC rule to evaluate if your AWS resources comply with your desired configurations. For information on how many CC rules you can have per account, see [Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/configlimits.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
 *  There are two types of rules: *Managed Rules* and *Custom Rules*. You can use the ``ConfigRule`` resource to create both CC Managed Rules and CC Custom Rules.
 *   CC Managed Rules are predefined, customizable rules created by CC. For a list of managed rules, see [List of Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html). If you are adding an CC managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier for the ``SourceIdentifier`` key.
 *   CC Custom Rules are rules that you create from scratch. There are two ways to create CC custom rules: with Lambda functions ([Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-function)) and with CFNGUARDshort ([Guard GitHub Repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard)), a policy-as-code language. CC custom rules created with LAMlong are called *Custom Lambda Rules* and CC custom rules created with CFNGUARDshort are called *Custom Policy Rules*.
 *  If you are adding a new CC Custom LAM rule, you first need to create an LAMlong function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you use the ``ConfigRule`` resource to add a Custom LAM rule to CC, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that LAMlong assigns to the function. You specify the ARN in the ``SourceIdentifier`` key. This key is part of the ``Source`` object, which is part of the ``ConfigRule`` object.
 *  For any new CC rule that you add, specify the ``ConfigRuleName`` in the ``ConfigRule`` object. Do not specify the ``ConfigRuleArn`` or the ``ConfigRuleId``. These values are generated by CC for new rules.
 *  If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule by ``ConfigRuleName``, ``ConfigRuleId``, or ``ConfigRuleArn`` in the ``ConfigRule`` data type that you use in this request.
 *  For more information about developing and using CC rules, see [Evaluating Resources with Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
