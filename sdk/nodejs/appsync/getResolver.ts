/**
 * The ``AWS::AppSync::Resolver`` resource defines the logical GraphQL resolver that you attach to fields in a schema. Request and response templates for resolvers are written in Apache Velocity Template Language (VTL) format. For more information about resolvers, see [Resolver Mapping Template Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference.html).
 *   When you submit an update, CFNLong updates resources based on differences between what you submit and the stack's current template. To cause this resource to be updated you must change a property value for this resource in the CFNshort template. Changing the S3 file content without changing a property value will not result in an update operation.
