/**
 * Specifies an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. You can create an empty volume, a volume from a snapshot, or a volume copy from an existing source volume.
 *
 * > - When you use AWS CloudFormation to update an Amazon EBS volume that modifies `Iops` , `Size` , or `VolumeType` , there is a cooldown period before another operation can occur. This can cause your stack to report being in `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS` or `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS` for long periods of time. Some common scenarios when you might encounter a cooldown period for Amazon EBS include:
 * > 
 * > - You successfully update an Amazon EBS volume and the update succeeds. When you attempt another update within the cooldown window, that update will be subject to a cooldown period.
 * > - You successfully update an Amazon EBS volume and the update succeeds but another change in your `update-stack` call fails. The rollback will be subject to a cooldown period.
 * > 
 * > For more information, see [Requirements for EBS volume modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/modify-volume-requirements.html) .
 * > - Amazon EBS does not support sizing down an Amazon EBS volume. AWS CloudFormation does not attempt to modify an Amazon EBS volume to a smaller size on rollback.
 *
 * *DeletionPolicy attribute*
 *
 * To control how AWS CloudFormation handles the volume when the stack is deleted, set a deletion policy for your volume. You can choose to retain the volume, to delete the volume, or to create a snapshot of the volume. For more information, see [DeletionPolicy attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html) .
 *
 * > If you set a deletion policy that creates a snapshot, all tags on the volume are included in the snapshot.
