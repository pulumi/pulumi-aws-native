/**
 * A grouping of protected resources so they can be handled as a collective. This resource grouping improves the accuracy of detection and reduces false positives.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws_native from "@pulumi/aws-native";
 *
 * const protectionGroup = new aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroup("protectionGroup", {
 *     protectionGroupId: "ProtectionGroupForAllResources",
 *     aggregation: aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroupAggregation.Sum,
 *     pattern: aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroupPattern.All,
 * });
 *
 * ```
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws_native from "@pulumi/aws-native";
 *
 * const protectionGroup = new aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroup("protectionGroup", {
 *     protectionGroupId: "ProtectionGroupForAllResources",
 *     aggregation: aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroupAggregation.Sum,
 *     pattern: aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroupPattern.All,
 * });
 *
 * ```
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws_native from "@pulumi/aws-native";
 *
 * const protectionGroup = new aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroup("protectionGroup", {
 *     protectionGroupId: "ProtectionGroupForAllEIPResources",
 *     aggregation: aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroupAggregation.Sum,
 *     pattern: aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroupPattern.ByResourceType,
 *     resourceType: aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroupResourceType.ElasticIpAllocation,
 * });
 *
 * ```
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws_native from "@pulumi/aws-native";
 *
 * const protectionGroup = new aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroup("protectionGroup", {
 *     protectionGroupId: "ProtectionGroupForAllEIPResources",
 *     aggregation: aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroupAggregation.Sum,
 *     pattern: aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroupPattern.ByResourceType,
 *     resourceType: aws_native.shield.ProtectionGroupResourceType.ElasticIpAllocation,
 * });
 *
 * ```
