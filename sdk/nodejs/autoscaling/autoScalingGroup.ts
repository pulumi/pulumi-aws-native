 *   Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling configures instances launched as part of an Auto Scaling group using either a [launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-launchtemplate.html) or a launch configuration. We strongly recommend that you do not use launch configurations.
