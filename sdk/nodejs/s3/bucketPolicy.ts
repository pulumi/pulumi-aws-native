/**
 * Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS-account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the ``PutBucketPolicy`` permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.
 *  If you don't have ``PutBucketPolicy`` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a ``403 Access Denied`` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` error.
 *    As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS-account that owns a bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.
 *   When using the ``AWS::S3::BucketPolicy`` resource, you can create, update, and delete bucket policies for S3 buckets located in regions different from the stack's region. This cross-region bucket policy modification functionality is supported for backward compatibility with existing workflows.
 *   If the [DeletionPolicy attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html) is not specified or set to ``Delete``, the bucket policy will be removed when the stack is deleted. If set to ``Retain``, the bucket policy will be preserved even after the stack is deleted.
 *   For example, a CloudFormation stack in ``us-east-1`` can use the ``AWS::S3::BucketPolicy`` resource to manage the bucket policy for an S3 bucket in ``us-west-2``. The retention or removal of the bucket policy during the stack deletion is determined by the ``DeletionPolicy`` attribute specified in the stack template.
 *  For more information, see [Bucket policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html).
 *  The following operations are related to ``PutBucketPolicy``:
 *   +   [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html)
 *   +   [DeleteBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html)
