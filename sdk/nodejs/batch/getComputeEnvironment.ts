If the AWS Batch service-linked role doesn't exist in your account, and no role is specified here, the service attempts to create the AWS Batch service-linked role in your account.

     * If your specified role has a path other than `/` , then you must specify either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name `bar` has a path of `/foo/` , specify `/foo/bar` as the role name.

When you only specify the name of the service role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the `service-role` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.

     * If the state is `ENABLED` , then the AWS Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.
     *
     * If the state is `DISABLED` , then the AWS Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a `STARTING` or `RUNNING` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the `DISABLED` state don't scale out.
