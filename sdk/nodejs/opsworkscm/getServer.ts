When you are specifying the value of CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY as a parameter in the AWS CloudFormation console, you must add newline ( `\n` ) characters at the end of each line of the pivotal key value.
     * - `CHEF_AUTOMATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` : The password for the administrative user in the Chef Automate web-based dashboard. The password length is a minimum of eight characters, and a maximum of 32. The password can contain letters, numbers, and special characters (!/@#$%^&+=_). The password must contain at least one lower case letter, one upper case letter, one number, and one special character. When no CHEF_AUTOMATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD is set, one is generated and returned in the response.

     * **Attributes accepted in a Puppet createServer request:** - `PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD` : To work with the Puppet Enterprise console, a password must use ASCII characters.
     * - `PUPPET_R10K_REMOTE` : The r10k remote is the URL of your control repository (for example, ssh://git@your.git-repo.com:user/control-repo.git). Specifying an r10k remote opens TCP port 8170.
     * - `PUPPET_R10K_PRIVATE_KEY` : If you are using a private Git repository, add PUPPET_R10K_PRIVATE_KEY to specify a PEM-encoded private SSH key.
