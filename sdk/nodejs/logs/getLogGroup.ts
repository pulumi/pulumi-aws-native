Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields that have high cardinality of values Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and instance IDs. For more information, see [Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs-Field-Indexing.html).
