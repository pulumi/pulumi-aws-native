/**
 * The ``AWS::Logs::LogGroup`` resource specifies a log group. A log group defines common properties for log streams, such as their retention and access control rules. Each log stream must belong to one log group.
 *  You can create up to 1,000,000 log groups per Region per account. You must use the following guidelines when naming a log group:
 *   +  Log group names must be unique within a Region for an AWS account.
 *   +  Log group names can be between 1 and 512 characters long.
 *   +  Log group names consist of the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), '/' (forward slash), and '.' (period).
