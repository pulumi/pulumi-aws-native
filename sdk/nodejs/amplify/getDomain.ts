     * - **IMPORTING_CUSTOM_CERTIFICATE** - Indicates that an Amplify custom certificate is in the process of being imported. This occurs during the creation of a custom domain or when a custom domain is updated to use a custom certificate.
     * - **PENDING_DEPLOYMENT** - Indicates that the subdomain or certificate changes are being propagated.
     * - **AWAITING_APP_CNAME** - Amplify is waiting for CNAME records corresponding to subdomains to be propagated. If your custom domain is on RouteÂ 53, Amplify handles this for you automatically. For more information about custom domains, see [Setting up custom domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html) in the *Amplify Hosting User Guide* .
     * - **UPDATE_COMPLETE** - The certificate has been associated with a domain.
     * - **UPDATE_FAILED** - The certificate has failed to be provisioned or associated, and there is no existing active certificate to roll back to.
