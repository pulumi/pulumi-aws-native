 * Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM group.
 *  A group can also have managed policies attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a group, use [AWS::IAM::Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-iam-group.html). To create a new managed policy, use [AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-managedpolicy.html). For information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
 *  For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed in a group, see [IAM and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
