     * In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack.
     *
     * - `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
     *
     * Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account ; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.
     *
     * The following IAM resources require you to specify either the `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.
     *
     * - If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
     * - If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` .
     * - If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.
     *
     * If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

     * - `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
     *
     * Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-include.html) and [AWS::Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html) transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation .
     *
     * If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros *and* nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.
     *
     * > You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.
     * > 
     * > Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified. 
     *
     * For more information, see [Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .
