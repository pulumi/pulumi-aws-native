Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability.

     * The length of time, in minutes, that CloudFormation waits for the nested stack to reach the `CREATE_COMPLETE` state. The default is no timeout. When CloudFormation detects that the nested stack has reached the `CREATE_COMPLETE` state, it marks the nested stack resource as `CREATE_COMPLETE` in the parent stack and resumes creating the parent stack. If the timeout period expires before the nested stack reaches `CREATE_COMPLETE` , CloudFormation marks the nested stack as failed and rolls back both the nested stack and parent stack.
