/**
 * The AWS::SSM::Association resource associates an SSM document in AWS Systems Manager with EC2 instances that contain a configuration agent to process the document.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws_native from "@pulumi/aws-native";
 *
 * const specificInstanceIdAssociation = new aws_native.ssm.Association("specificInstanceIdAssociation", {
 *     name: "AWS-RunShellScript",
 *     targets: [{
 *         key: "InstanceIds",
 *         values: ["i-1234567890abcdef0"],
 *     }],
 *     parameters: {
 *         commands: ["ls"],
 *         workingDirectory: ["/"],
 *     },
 * });
 *
 * ```
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws_native from "@pulumi/aws-native";
 *
 * const specificInstanceIdAssociation = new aws_native.ssm.Association("specificInstanceIdAssociation", {
 *     name: "AWS-RunShellScript",
 *     targets: [{
 *         key: "InstanceIds",
 *         values: ["i-1234567890abcdef0"],
 *     }],
 *     parameters: {
 *         commands: ["ls"],
 *         workingDirectory: ["/"],
 *     },
 * });
 *
 * ```
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws_native from "@pulumi/aws-native";
 *
 * const allInstanceIdsAssociation = new aws_native.ssm.Association("allInstanceIdsAssociation", {
 *     associationName: "UpdateSSMAgent",
 *     name: "AWS-UpdateSSMAgent",
 *     scheduleExpression: "cron(0 2 ? * SUN *)",
 *     targets: [{
 *         key: "InstanceIds",
 *         values: ["*"],
 *     }],
 * });
 *
 * ```
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws_native from "@pulumi/aws-native";
 *
 * const allInstanceIdsAssociation = new aws_native.ssm.Association("allInstanceIdsAssociation", {
 *     associationName: "UpdateSSMAgent",
 *     name: "AWS-UpdateSSMAgent",
 *     scheduleExpression: "cron(0 2 ? * SUN *)",
 *     targets: [{
 *         key: "InstanceIds",
 *         values: ["*"],
 *     }],
 * });
 *
 * ```
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws_native from "@pulumi/aws-native";
 *
 * const taggedInstancesAssociation = new aws_native.ssm.Association("taggedInstancesAssociation", {
 *     associationName: "UpdateSSMAgent",
 *     name: "AWS-UpdateSSMAgent",
 *     scheduleExpression: "rate(7 days)",
 *     targets: [{
 *         key: "tag:Environment",
 *         values: ["Production"],
 *     }],
 * });
 *
 * ```
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws_native from "@pulumi/aws-native";
 *
 * const taggedInstancesAssociation = new aws_native.ssm.Association("taggedInstancesAssociation", {
