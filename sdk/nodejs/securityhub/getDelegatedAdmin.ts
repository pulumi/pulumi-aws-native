/**
 * The ``AWS::SecurityHub::DelegatedAdmin`` resource designates the delegated ASHlong administrator account for an organization. You must enable the integration between ASH and AOlong before you can designate a delegated ASH administrator. Only the management account for an organization can designate the delegated ASH administrator account. For more information, see [Designating the delegated administrator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/designate-orgs-admin-account.html#designate-admin-instructions) in the *User Guide*.
 *  To change the delegated administrator account, remove the current delegated administrator account, and then designate the new account.
 *  To designate multiple delegated administrators in different organizations and AWS-Regions, we recommend using [mappings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/mappings-section-structure.html).
 *  Tags aren't supported for this resource.
