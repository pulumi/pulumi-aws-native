Each dimension value is evaluated independently. If you start incurring cost in a new value of your chosen dimension, it will automatically be analyzed by an AWS managed monitor.

 * Set this to `CUSTOM` for a customer managed monitor. Customer managed monitors let you select specific dimension values that get monitored in aggregate.
