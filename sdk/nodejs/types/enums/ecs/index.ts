 *   +  ``ROLLING``: When you create a service which uses the *rolling update* (``ROLLING``) deployment strategy, the ECS service scheduler replaces the currently running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that ECS adds or removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by the service deployment configuration. 
 *  Rolling update deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:
 *   +  Gradual service updates: You need to update your service incrementally without taking the entire service offline at once.
 *   +  Limited resource requirements: You want to avoid the additional resource costs of running two complete environments simultaneously (as required by blue/green deployments).
 *   +  Acceptable deployment time: Your application can tolerate a longer deployment process, as rolling updates replace tasks one by one.
 *   +  No need for instant roll back: Your service can tolerate a rollback process that takes minutes rather than seconds.
 *   +  Simple deployment process: You prefer a straightforward deployment approach without the complexity of managing multiple environments, target groups, and listeners.
 *   +  No load balancer requirement: Your service doesn't use or require a load balancer, ALB, NLB, or Service Connect (which are required for blue/green deployments).
 *   +  Stateful applications: Your application maintains state that makes it difficult to run two parallel environments.
 *   +  Cost sensitivity: You want to minimize deployment costs by not running duplicate environments during deployment.
 *   
 *  Rolling updates are the default deployment strategy for services and provide a balance between deployment safety and resource efficiency for many common application scenarios.
 *   +  ``BLUE_GREEN``: A *blue/green* deployment strategy (``BLUE_GREEN``) is a release methodology that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called blue and green. With ECS blue/green deployments, you can validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to them. This approach provides a safer way to deploy changes with the ability to quickly roll back if needed.
 *  ECS blue/green deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:
 *   +  Service validation: When you need to validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to them
 *   +  Zero downtime: When your service requires zero-downtime deployments
 *   +  Instant roll back: When you need the ability to quickly roll back if issues are detected
 *   +  Load balancer requirement: When your service uses ALB, NLB, or Service Connect
 *   
 *   
 *   +  External
 *  Use a third-party deployment controller.
 *   +  Blue/green deployment (powered by ACD)
 *  ACD installs an updated version of the application as a new replacement task set and reroutes production traffic from the original application task set to the replacement task set. The original task set is terminated after a successful deployment. Use this deployment controller to verify a new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to it.
 *   
 *  When updating the deployment controller for a service, consider the following depending on the type of migration you're performing.
 *   +  If you have a template that contains the ``EXTERNAL`` deployment controller information as well as ``TaskSet`` and ``PrimaryTaskSet`` resources, and you remove the task set resources from the template when updating from ``EXTERNAL`` to ``ECS``, the ``DescribeTaskSet`` and ``DeleteTaskSet`` API calls will return a 400 error after the deployment controller is updated to ``ECS``. This results in a delete failure on the task set resources, even though the stack transitions to ``UPDATE_COMPLETE`` status. For more information, see [Resource removed from stack but not deleted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-resource-removed-not-deleted) in the CFNlong User Guide. To fix this issue, delete the task sets directly using the ECS``DeleteTaskSet`` API. For more information about how to delete a task set, see [DeleteTaskSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteTaskSet.html) in the ECSlong API Reference.
 *   +  If you're migrating from ``CODE_DEPLOY`` to ``ECS`` with a new task definition and CFN performs a rollback operation, the ECS``UpdateService`` request fails with the following error:
 *  Resource handler returned message: "Invalid request provided: Unable to update task definition on services with a CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller. 
 *   +  After a successful migration from ``ECS`` to ``EXTERNAL`` deployment controller, you need to manually remove the ``ACTIVE`` task set, because ECS no longer manages the deployment.
