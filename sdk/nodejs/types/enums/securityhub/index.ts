/**
 * The condition to apply to the key value when filtering Security Hub findings with a map filter.
 *
 * To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
 *
 * - To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department CONTAINS Security` matches findings that include the value `Security` for the `Department` tag. In the same example, a finding with a value of `Security team` for the `Department` tag is a match.
 * - To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department EQUALS Security` matches findings that have the value `Security` for the `Department` tag.
 *
 * `CONTAINS` and `EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Department CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that includes either `Security` , `Finance` , or both values.
 *
 * To search for values that don't have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
 *
 * - To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` matches findings that exclude the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.
 * - To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_EQUALS Finance` matches findings that don’t have the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.
 *
 * `NOT_CONTAINS` and `NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that excludes both the `Security` and `Finance` values.
 *
 * `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.
 *
 * You can’t have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can’t have both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
 *
 * `CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *AWS Security Hub User Guide* .

 * - `RESOLVED` - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now considered resolved.
 * - `SUPPRESSED` - Indicates that you reviewed the finding and do not believe that any action is needed. The finding is no longer updated.
