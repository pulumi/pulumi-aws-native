 * The comparison type. You can either choose `ONE_TO_ONE` or `MANY_TO_MANY` as the AttributeMatchingModel.

For example, if the value of the `Email` field of Profile A and the value of `BusinessEmail` field of Profile B matches, the two profiles are matched on the `Email` type. When choosing `ONE_TO_ONE` ,the system can only match if the sub-types are exact matches. For example, only when the value of the `Email` field of Profile A and the value of the `Email` field of Profile B matches, the two profiles are matched on the `Email` type.
