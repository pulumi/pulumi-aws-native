/**
 * The AWS::IoTEvents::DetectorModel resource creates a detector model. You create a *detector model* (a model of your equipment or process) using *states*. For each state, you define conditional (Boolean) logic that evaluates the incoming inputs to detect significant events. When an event is detected, it can change the state or trigger custom-built or predefined actions using other AWS services. You can define additional events that trigger actions when entering or exiting a state and, optionally, when a condition is met. For more information, see [How to Use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/developerguide/how-to-use-iotevents.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
 *   When you successfully update a detector model (using the ITE console, ITE API or CLI commands, or CFN) all detector instances created by the model are reset to their initial states. (The detector's ``state``, and the values of any variables and timers are reset.)
 *  When you successfully update a detector model (using the ITE console, ITE API or CLI commands, or CFN) the version number of the detector model is incremented. (A detector model with version number 1 before the update has version number 2 after the update succeeds.)
 *  If you attempt to update a detector model using CFN and the update does not succeed, the system may, in some cases, restore the original detector model. When this occurs, the detector model's version is incremented twice (for example, from version 1 to version 3) and the detector instances are reset.
 *  Also, be aware that if you attempt to update several detector models at once using CFN, some updates may succeed and others fail. In this case, the effects on each detector model's detector instances and version number depend on whether the update succeeded or failed, with the results as stated.
