/**
 * The ``AWS::KMS::Key`` resource specifies an [KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#kms_keys) in KMSlong. You can use this resource to create symmetric encryption KMS keys, asymmetric KMS keys for encryption or signing, and symmetric HMAC KMS keys. You can use ``AWS::KMS::Key`` to create [multi-Region primary keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html#mrk-primary-key) of all supported types. To replicate a multi-Region key, use the ``AWS::KMS::ReplicaKey`` resource.
 *   If you change the value of the ``KeySpec``, ``KeyUsage``, ``Origin``, or ``MultiRegion`` properties of an existing KMS key, the update request fails, regardless of the value of the [UpdateReplacePolicy attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatereplacepolicy.html). This prevents you from accidentally deleting a KMS key by changing any of its immutable property values.
 *     KMS replaced the term *customer master key (CMK)* with ** and *KMS key*. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.
 *   You can use symmetric encryption KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are more commonly used to generate data keys and data key pairs. You can also use a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt data stored in AWS services that are [integrated with](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration). For more information, see [Symmetric encryption KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#symmetric-cmks) in the *Developer Guide*.
 *  You can use asymmetric KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt data or sign messages and verify signatures. To create an asymmetric key, you must specify an asymmetric ``KeySpec`` value and a ``KeyUsage`` value. For details, see [Asymmetric keys in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
 *  You can use HMAC KMS keys (which are also symmetric keys) to generate and verify hash-based message authentication codes. To create an HMAC key, you must specify an HMAC ``KeySpec`` value and a ``KeyUsage`` value of ``GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC``. For details, see [HMAC keys in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/hmac.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
 *  You can also create symmetric encryption, asymmetric, and HMAC multi-Region primary keys. To create a multi-Region primary key, set the ``MultiRegion`` property to ``true``. For information about multi-Region keys, see [Multi-Region keys in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
 *  You cannot use the ``AWS::KMS::Key`` resource to specify a KMS key with [imported key material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html) or a KMS key in a [custom key store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html).
 *   *Regions*
 *   KMS CloudFormation resources are available in all Regions in which KMS and CFN are supported. You can use the ``AWS::KMS::Key`` resource to create and manage all KMS key types that are supported in a Region.

     * The key policy to attach to the KMS key.
     *  If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:
     *   +  The key policy must allow the caller to make a subsequent [PutKeyPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_PutKeyPolicy.html) request on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more information, see [Default key policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam) in the *Developer Guide*. (To omit this condition, set ``BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck`` to true.)
     *   +  Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more information, see [Changes that I make are not always immediately visible](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency) in the *User Guide*.
     *   
     *  If you do not provide a key policy, KMS attaches a default key policy to the KMS key. For more information, see [Default key policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default) in the *Developer Guide*.
     *  A key policy document can include only the following characters:
     *   +  Printable ASCII characters
     *   +  Printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set
     *   +  The tab (``\u0009``), line feed (``\u000A``), and carriage return (``\u000D``) special characters
     *   
     *   *Minimum*: ``1`` 
     *   *Maximum*: ``32768``

     *  When you remove a KMS key from a CloudFormation stack, KMS schedules the KMS key for deletion and starts the mandatory waiting period. The ``PendingWindowInDays`` property determines the length of waiting period. During the waiting period, the key state of KMS key is ``Pending Deletion`` or ``Pending Replica Deletion``, which prevents the KMS key from being used in cryptographic operations.

If you remove a multi-Region primary key from a CloudFormation stack, its key state changes to ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` so it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This state can persist indefinitely. When the last of its replica keys is deleted, the key state of the primary key changes to ``PendingDeletion`` and the waiting period specified by ``PendingWindowInDays`` begins.
