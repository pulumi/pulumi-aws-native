     * - For the `G.1X` worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPUs, 16 GB of memory) with 84GB disk (approximately 34GB free), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.
     * - For the `G.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPUs, 32 GB of memory) with 128GB disk (approximately 77GB free), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.
     * - For the `G.4X` worker type, each worker maps to 4 DPU (16 vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 256GB disk (approximately 235GB free), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only for AWS Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), and Europe (Stockholm).
     * - For the `G.8X` worker type, each worker maps to 8 DPU (32 vCPUs, 128 GB of memory) with 512GB disk (approximately 487GB free), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only for AWS Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs, in the same AWS Regions as supported for the `G.4X` worker type.
     * - For the `G.025X` worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2 vCPUs, 4 GB of memory) with 84GB disk (approximately 34GB free), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for low volume streaming jobs. This worker type is only available for AWS Glue version 3.0 streaming jobs.
     * - For the `Z.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 M-DPU (8vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 128 GB disk (approximately 120GB free), and provides up to 8 Ray workers based on the autoscaler.
