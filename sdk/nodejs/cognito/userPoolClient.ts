     *

     *

     *
     * - `ALLOW_USER_AUTH` : Enable selection-based sign-in with `USER_AUTH` . This setting covers username-password, secure remote password (SRP), passwordless, and passkey authentication. This authentiation flow can do username-password and SRP authentication without other `ExplicitAuthFlows` permitting them.

     * - `ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` : Enable admin based user password authentication flow `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` . This setting replaces the `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH` setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password.
     * - `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH` : Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.
     * - `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` : Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.
     * - `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH` : Enable SRP-based authentication.
     * - `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` : Enable authflow to refresh tokens.
     *

     * The [authentication flows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow-methods.html) that you want your user pool client to support. For each app client in your user pool, you can sign in your users with any combination of one or more flows, including with a user name and Secure Remote Password (SRP), a user name and password, or a custom authentication process that you define with Lambda functions.
     *
     * > If you don't specify a value for `ExplicitAuthFlows` , your app client supports `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` , `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH` , and `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH` . 
     *
     * The values for authentication flow options include the following.
     *
     * - `ALLOW_USER_AUTH` : Enable selection-based sign-in with `USER_AUTH` . This setting covers username-password, secure remote password (SRP), passwordless, and passkey authentication. This authentiation flow can do username-password and SRP authentication without other `ExplicitAuthFlows` permitting them. For example users can complete an SRP challenge through `USER_AUTH` without the flow `USER_SRP_AUTH` being active for the app client. This flow doesn't include `CUSTOM_AUTH` .
     *
     * To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the [Essentials tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html) or higher.
     * - `ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` : Enable admin based user password authentication flow `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` . This setting replaces the `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH` setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password.
     * - `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH` : Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.
     * - `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` : Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.
     * - `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH` : Enable SRP-based authentication.
     * - `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` : Enable authflow to refresh tokens.
     *
     * In some environments, you will see the values `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH` , `CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY` , or `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` . You can't assign these legacy `ExplicitAuthFlows` values to user pool clients at the same time as values that begin with `ALLOW_` ,
