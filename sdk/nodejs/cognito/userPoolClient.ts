This authentiation flow can do username-password and SRP authentication without other `ExplicitAuthFlows` permitting them. For example users can complete an SRP challenge through `USER_AUTH` without the flow `USER_SRP_AUTH` being active for the app client. This flow doesn't include `CUSTOM_AUTH` .
     * - `ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` : Enable admin based user password authentication flow `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` . This setting replaces the `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH` setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password.
     * - `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH` : Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.
     * - `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` : Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.
     * - `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH` : Enable SRP-based authentication.
     * - `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` : Enable authflow to refresh tokens.
