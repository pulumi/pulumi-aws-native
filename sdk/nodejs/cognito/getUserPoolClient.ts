     *
     * > If you don't specify a value for `ExplicitAuthFlows` , your app client supports `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` , `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH` , and `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH` . 
     *
     * The values for authentication flow options include the following.
     *
     * - `ALLOW_USER_AUTH` : Enable selection-based sign-in with `USER_AUTH` . This setting covers username-password, secure remote password (SRP), passwordless, and passkey authentication. This authentiation flow can do username-password and SRP authentication without other `ExplicitAuthFlows` permitting them. For example users can complete an SRP challenge through `USER_AUTH` without the flow `USER_SRP_AUTH` being active for the app client. This flow doesn't include `CUSTOM_AUTH` .
     *
     * To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the [Essentials tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html) or higher.
     * - `ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` : Enable admin based user password authentication flow `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` . This setting replaces the `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH` setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password.
     * - `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH` : Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.
     * - `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` : Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.
     * - `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH` : Enable SRP-based authentication.
     * - `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` : Enable authflow to refresh tokens.
     *
